django-ldapdb is an LDAP database backend for Django.
It allows you to manipulate LDAP entries using Django's models.
Declaring models using the LDAP backend is very staightforward,
 you simply inherit from ldapdb.models.Model and declare the fields
 in the same way as for regular models.
You can even edit the LDAP entries using Django's admin interface.
