Add "filer" to your project's INSTALLED_APPS setting and run syncdb
(or migrate if you're using South).

You might consider using django-filer with the django CMS plugin and
its components instead of cms.plugins.file, cms.plugins.picture,
cms.plugins.teaser and cms.plugins.video core plugins.  In this case
you should not add them to INSTALLED_APPS but add those instead:

    'filer'
    'cmsplugin_filer_file'
    'cmsplugin_filer_folder'
    'cmsplugin_filer_image'
    'cmsplugin_filer_teaser'
    'cmsplugin_filer_video'

(Note that this also requires the installation of cmsplugin-filer.)
