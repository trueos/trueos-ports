A simple graphics library, designed to give the programmer access to
most interesting parts of the Win32 Graphics Device Interface and X11
library without exposing the programmer to the pain and anguish usually
associated with using these interfaces.  The library also includes a
module Graphics.SOE providing the interface used in "The Haskell School
of Expression", by Paul Hudak.
