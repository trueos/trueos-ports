This is a collection of data structures and algorithms useful for
building bioinformatics-related tools and utilities. Current list of
features includes: a Sequence data type supporting protein and
nucleotide sequences and conversion between them. As of version 0.4,
different kinds of sequence have different types. Support for quality
data, reading and writing Fasta formatted files, reading TwoBit and phd
formats, and Roche/454 SFF files. Rudimentary (i.e. unoptimized) support
for doing alignments - including dynamic adjustment of scores based on
sequence quality. Also Blast output parsing. Partly implemented single
linkage clustering, and multiple alignment. Reading Gene Ontology (GO)
annotations (GOA) and definitions hierarchy.
