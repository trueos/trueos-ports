An efficient packed, immutable Unicode text type (both strict and lazy),
with a powerful loop fusion optimization framework.

The Text type represents Unicode character strings, in a time and
space-efficient manner.  This package provides text processing
capabilities that are optimized for performance critical use, both in
terms of large data quantities and high speed.

The Text type provides character-encoding, type-safe case conversion via
whole-string case conversion functions.  It also provides a range of
functions for converting Text values to and from ByteStrings, using
several standard encodings.

Efficient locale-sensitive support for text IO is also supported.
