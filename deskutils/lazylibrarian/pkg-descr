LazyLibrarian is a program to follow authors and grab metadata for all your digital reading needs. It uses Goodreads.com (for author info and book info) websites as a source. License: GNU GPL v3

Right now its capable of the following:

    Find authors and add them to the database
    List all books of an author and add them as 'wanted'.
    LazyLibrarian will search a nzb-file for that book (only Newznab and nzbmatrix are currently supported)
    If a nzb is found it will be send to sabnzbd or saved in a blackhole where your downloadapp can pick it up.
    When processing the downloaded books it will save a coverpicture (if available) and save all metadata into metadata.opf next to the bookfile (calibre compatible format)
    The new theme for the site allows it to be accessed (and usable) from devices with a smaller screen (such as an iPad)
    AutoAdd feature for book management tools like Calibre which must have books in flattened directory structure
    Added Usenet Crawler configuration + 2 NZB configurations (alas NZBMatrix is gone and removed)
